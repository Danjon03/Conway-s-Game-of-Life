# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

This is my Attempt at Conway's Game of Life.

When the program starts, you can click on any of the squares and a green dot will appear. 
Place enough dots, and when you press enter to start the simulation, the green dots will interact to make new pictures.
If you click on a green dot, it will automatically turn into a black dot.

On order to run this file, you will need a JRE: Java Runtime Environment. You will need to download Java 11 or higher.
